You can run `npm run watch` to automatically rebuild the project when the files change. You'll have to
manually restart the app though (maybe we can livereload it somehow? #13).

Don't use `console.log` since it'll overwrite the app's output. Instead, `import screen` and do
`screen.debug`. Those logs will show up in the Debug log pane that appears if you press F12.

It's ok to use `console.error` if you're about to exit the process.
